## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1️⃣ Start MCP Server
```powershell
npm run mcp:start
```
→ Server listens on http://localhost:5000

### 2️⃣ Open Live Dashboard
```
file:///c:\Users\lokesh.sharma\playwright-js-E2E-Automation\mcp-dashboard.html
```
→ Shows "Connected" status

### 3️⃣ Start Auto-Run Scheduler
```powershell
npm run k6:auto-run
```
→ Scheduled for daily 2 AM (configurable)

## 🔄 How It Works

```
SCHEDULED TIME (Daily 2 AM)
         ↓
   PHASE 1: HEALTH CHECK
   ├─ K6 available?
   ├─ Network OK?
   ├─ Disk space sufficient?
   └─ Send status to MCP
         ↓
   PHASE 2: AUTO-HEALING (if needed)
   ├─ Restart K6 if unavailable
   ├─ Clear disk if low
   └─ Retry network connectivity
         ↓
   PHASE 3: TEST EXECUTION
   ├─ Run K6 multi-stage test
   ├─ Monitor CPU usage
   └─ Retry on failure (max 3)
         ↓
   PHASE 4: RESULTS
   ├─ Parse metrics
   ├─ Update dashboard
   └─ Notify MCP server
         ↓
   Dashboard Updates in Real-Time
```

## 🏥 Self-Healing Examples

| Issue | Detection | Action | Result |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| K6 crashes | Version check fails | Kill orphans, reinitialize | Test resumes |
| Disk full | < 5GB space | Clear temp files | More space freed |
| Network down | Connection timeout | Retry (3x) with delays | Connectivity restored |
| Test stalls | Timeout exceeded | Kill process | Marked as failed, retried |
